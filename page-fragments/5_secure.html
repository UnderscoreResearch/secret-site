                    <p>
                        In short this is secure because at no point during the interaction with the central service are the encryption keys transmitted
                        over the internet. In fact, at no point during your interaction with the service does it ever possess the keys to access
                        anything confidential including the addresses of the secret caretakers with two small exception.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            If you chose to use service based unlock notifications the service does know the address to send this notification to.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            When sending any kind of email notifications, the addresses of the recipients of the messages will be sent to the service
                            when the notification is sent. However, this information is not logged, nor is it then stored by the service for later
                            retrieval.

                        Why should I trust that this is what actually happens?
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        The public API and implementation of the service and front end is entirely open source. Furthermore, since all the secrets are
                        supposed to never leave the front end this is the only piece that you really need to trust. Because of this work has been made
                        to make it relatively trivial to download and run your own front end from the GitHub repository in case you do not trust what
                        is actually running on the website is in fact what is published in the repository.

                        Let us start going through how a secret gets created, published and retrieved.
                        To start things of here is a small sequence diagram showing the general flow of information.

                        Submitting information
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        When an information disclosure is created a private key for the information is created on the client of the creator. All public
                        key encryption uses a 512-bit long private key using Elliptic Curve Cryptography. The information is then encrypted and signed
                        in the client before it is sent to the service. At this point the actual information can be included or not. If it is included
                        it will be encrypted using the private key for the whole information disclosure.
                    </p>
                    <h3>
                        Sending out invitations to caretakers
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        At this point you will create caretakers for your information. You can have up to 15 trusted caretakers. The caretaker will be
                        emailed a message with a link that allows them to accept the invitation which is required before the information is published.
                    </p>
                    <h3>
                        Accepting the caretaker role
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        When a caretaker accepts the invitation a new 512-bit private key is generated on the client side in the caretaker's browser.
                        The public key of this private key is sent to the service along with an address that is encrypted using a symmetrical
                        encryption. The key for address encryption is derived from the Diffie-Hellman key exchange using the two keys from the caretaker
                        and the secret. Please note that this key is never transmitted to the service but is known by both the creator of the secret
                        and the caretaker (Given that they each know a private key).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Also included to the service is the double SHA-512 hash of this encryption key. The reason for this is that to initiate an
                        unlocking of a secret the unlocking caretaker need to demonstrate that all recipient keys are known by submitting a list
                        of their single SHA-512 hashes of the same keys.
                    </p>
                    <h3>
                        Publishing the information
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        Once the publisher of the information is satisfied that enough caretakers have accept the invitations the information can now
                        be published. Before the information is published it is encrypted using the private key of the creator.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Once the information is published a new key 256-bit symmetric encryption key is used to encrypt the information. This key is
                        then split into the number of keys required, one for each caretaker, using
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamir%27s_Secret_Sharing">Shamir's Secret Sharing algorithm</a>.
                        At this point you also need to specify how many keys are required in tandem to unlock and retrieve the information.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The data to be published to the secret is then encrypted using symmetrical encryption with the key generated above as the
                        encryption key. If you opt to not be able to update the information, there is no way to retrieve the published information by
                        the creator of the information after it is published. If you chose to keep being able to update the secret publish operation
                        can be done as many times as needed to update the caretaker list after publishing. The service will also contain a double
                        SHA-512 has of the encryption key that will later be used to demonstrate knowledge of the original key during retrieval of the
                        unlocked information.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Each one of the generated keys is then written to a caretaker encrypted using the public key of the caretaker as published to
                        the service when they accepted the invitation. The publisher of the information also has the option to choose which of the
                        caretakers should be able to initiate unlocking the secret. If a caretaker has been designated such, the keys for decrypting the
                        addresses of all the caretakers is also saved encrypted using the same public key of the caretaker.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        All calls during this phase must be authenticated using the private key of the creator.

                    <p>
                        When a caretaker decides that an unlocking of the information is warranted a call is made to the service authenticated using the
                        private key of the caretaker generated during the accept phase where the caretaker includes an SHA-512 has of all the encryption
                        keys for the addresses of all the other caretakers addresses. These are then hashed again on the service side and compared against
                        the double hashes saved per caretaker as part of accepting the invitation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If correct it will optionally send out an unlock notification to the information's creator. Once this has been sent out the
                        creator has 7 days to either block the unlock or delete the entire information submission if they so choose before the unlocking
                        caretaker can access the information.

                    <p>
                        Immediately when the unlock has been accepted the caretaker can query the encrypted addresses of all the other caretakers, they
                        can be decrypted with the individual encryption keys made available only to the unlocking caretakers and an email can be sent out
                        requesting that the other caretakers will start submitting their part of the unlocking keys.

                    <p>
                        When an unlock request has been initiated all caretakers will be messaged and requested to submit their keys. At this point they
                        will need to log in authenticated using their private key from the accept phase to retrieve their part of the shared secret. This
                        is then decrypted using their private key on the client side and re-encrypted using the public key of the caretaker requesting
                        the unlock and saved back to the service for each caretaker.

                    <p>
                        Once sufficient caretakers have submitted their part of the key to reconstitute the entire symmetric encryption key and at least
                        7 days has passed since the unlock was initiated the caretaker can make a request to the service requesting to read the secret by
                        authenticating using their private key and also including an SHA-512 digest of the decryption key.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If the service can validate all this data, it will return the information including the data to the unlocking caretaker which can
                        then proceed to decrypt the data within.

                        If the unlocking caretaker of the information so choses they can once the information of the secret is unlocked decide to reshare
                        access to any of the participating caretakers. The unlocking caretaker submits a request to share the information which includes a
                        map which contains an entry for every caretaker that that should also be able to access the information as the key. The value of
                        this map is the symmetric encryption key of the information encrypted using the public key of each caretaker. A notification is
                        then sent out to the caretakers notifying them that they now have access to the information as well. It is worth noting that the
                        information is still signed by the original private key of the creator so by doing this all shared to caretakers are still able to
                        validate that the information has not been tampered with.

                        Given the long-term nature of a service like this there is a very distinct chance that people might during a disclosure's lifetime
                        change addresses. Because of this at any time a caretaker can make a request authenticated with their private key and update,
                        add and remove addresses attached to them. The addresses are still encrypted using the same key from the original key exchange
                        since this key is also distributed to all caretakers that have unlocking privileges it cannot be changed.

                    <p>
                        While this is true. This service does assume that you do not have malicious things in your browser or computer. The service does
                        try its best to protect you from bad things happening inside of the JavaScript container. Specifically, the site will never have
                        ads or in any way consume any packages coming from any third party vendors. This is also easily verifiable by anybody using the
                        networking developer tab and notice that the site does not fetch anything from any server except
                        <a href="https://yoursharedsecret.com">https://yoursharedsecret.com</a> or <a href="https://api.yoursharedsecret.com/">https://api*.yoursharedsecret.com/</a>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The one exception to third party API:s is the use of the payment processor API. However, care has been taken to only load this
                        code into the service when it is actually needed which is when information is first submitted. If you are worried about this,
                        please use either Bitcoin or Ethereum to pay for the service which even though it is a call to an outside service it is a simple
                        REST call in the back end and not downloading any code from a remote service. Another alternative is to create the information
                        submission first without entering any information and pay for it and then after you have restarted your browser you can open up
                        the information submission that is now already paid for and submit the actual confidential information.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The front end is also implemented as a static single page application so there are no requests going back and forth between the
                        browser and service containing any state. The only communication after fetching the code of the single page is the explicit
                        calls being made to the API, again except for making payments with credit cards.
