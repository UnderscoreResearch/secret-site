                        Everything is currently running in AWS in the us-west-2 region (Oregon). There is also a stripped-down version of the API that only
                        allows sending messages that operate in the eu-west-1 region (Ireland) and eu-central-1 (Frankfurt). The secondary regions are there
                        to alleviate the chance that some entity can perform a successful man in the middle attack when sending out invitations.

                        The deployment is using <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/">AWS CodePipelines</a> deploying code from a
                        <a href="https://github.com/UnderscoreResearch/secret-site">GitHub repository</a> using
                        <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/codebuild/">AWS CodeBuild</a> to package the site and run tests created
                        using the <a href="http://cypress.io">Cypress</a> test framework.

                        The entire storage layer is implemented using <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/">Amazon S3</a>.
                        The API is implemented using <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/">Amazon API Gateway</a> that points to a function running Node.js code in
                        <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/">AWS Lambda</a>

                        There are two external services used by the system and both are related to payment processing. The first is <a href="https://squareup.com/">Square</a>
                        that is used to process regular payments. The second is <a href="https://www.blockcypher.com/">BlockCypher</a> which is used to verify Bitcoin
                         and Ethereum transactions.

                    <p>
                        Decided to just to go all in on the whole AWS experience and most of the code is also developed using <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloud9/">AWS Cloud9</a> and
                        <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/codestar/">AWS CodeStar</a>. The main reason GitHub was used instead of the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/codecommit/">AWS CodeCommit</a>
                        was that one requirement was to deploy to several regions from a single GitHub repository.

                    <h1>Infrastructure security</h1>
                    <p>
                        All accounts related to this service including DNS, other infrastructure and source code have good passwords and second factor authentication set up on them.
                        AWS best practices are followed including using only temporary credentials for any runtime and all policies are using least required credentials for access
                        to AWS resources.
                    </p>
                    <h1>Logging and monitoring</h1>
                    <p>
                        Not included in the diagram but all monitoring, alarming and logs are done in <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/">Amazon CloudWatch</a>.
                        No logs are kept for longer than 2 weeks. No access logs are generated for the website and for the API the access logs are logged in the following format.
                    </p>

                    <h1>Specific encryption specifications</h1>
                    <p>
                        Here are the detailed encryption specifications used by this system.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Symmetric Encryption</h2>
                    <p>
                        Anything that is said to be encrypted with symmetric encryption is encrypted using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salsa20">xsalsa20</a>-
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poly1305">poly1305</a>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Any key will always be 32 bytes long (256 bits).
                    </p>
                    <h2>Public key signing</h2>
                    <p>
                        Anything signed with a private key uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EdDSA#Ed25519">Edwards-curve Digital Signature Algorithm (EdDSA)</a>
                        with the Ed25519 curve.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Any public keys will always be 32 bytes long. Any private keys will be 64 (512 bits) bytes long although the last 32 bytes are a copy of the
                        public key. These are the keys that are generated and given to both secret owners and caretakers.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The fingerprint of the caretaker is simply the hex of the first 8 bytes of the public key.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Public key encryption</h2>
                    <p>
                        Anything encrypted with a private key uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve25519">x25519</a>-<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salsa20">xsalsa20</a>-
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poly1305">poly1305</a>. An ephemeral private key is generated, and its public key is stored with the
                        data. This ephemeral key is used with the public key related to the private key used for decryption to generate a derived key through a
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic-curve_Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman">Elliptic-curve Diffie–Hellman</a> key exchange.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The private and public keys used for encryption are directly derived from the private and public keys used for signing. It is important to
                        note that it has not been proven that this does not weaken the use of these keys (Although it has not been shown that it does either).
                    </p>
                    <h2>Shared Secret Encryption</h2>
                    <p>
                        The shared secret crypto uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamir%27s_Secret_Sharing">Shamir's Secret Sharing algorithm</a>.
                        The actual encryption key is 256 bits long. It is encrypted using a Galois field of 8 bits (Since we only need 15 keys this is more than sufficient).
                    </p>
                    <h2>Secure Data Format</h2>
                    <p>
                        All secure data is stored in a binary format that is the same regardless of if it encrypted with a private key, a symmetric key or a derived
                        shared key. The format always includes a signature and has an option of also including plain text data that is only signed if so desired.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><code>version</code> - Version marker, this is currently always 0x01 (1 byte).</li>
                        <li><code>nonceSize</code> - Size of nonce used for the encryption. If the message is in clear text the nonceSize is 0 otherwise it is the
                            number of bytes of the nonce (1 byte). This value is always either 0 or 24.</li>
                        <li><code>nonce</code> - Nonce used to seed the stream cypher used for encryption (nonceSize bytes).</li>
                        <li><code>publicKeySize</code> - The size of the public key data for an ephemeral private key used to encrypt (1 byte). This value is
                            always either 0 or 32.</li>
                        <li><code>publicKey</code> - The public key of the private key used for an ephemeral
                            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic-curve_Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman">Elliptic-curve Diffie–Hellman</a> key exchange when
                            encrypting the data (publicKeySize bytes).</li>
                        <li><code>signatureSize</code> - The size of the signature data (1 byte). This value currently always 32.</li>
                        <li><code>signature</code> - The signature of the data as generated using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EdDSA#Ed25519">EdDSA</a>
                            algorithm (signatureSize bytes).</li>
                        <li><code>message</code> - The actual encrypted or clear text message (Rest of bytes). If encrypted this will contain an additional
                            16-byte MAC in the beginning before the cypher text used to authenticate the key used.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2>Format of keys for end users</h2>
                    <p>
                        The keys take the form of several separate pieces separated by a <code>/</code> character. Each piece start with a single character
                        identifier and a <code>=</code> character.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><code>s=</code> Secret identifier.</li>
                        <li><code>p=</code> Private key. Encoded using Base64 URL safe encoding.</li>

                        <li><code>d=</code> Data decryption key. Encoded using Base64 URL safe encoding. Only included if the secret owner has opted to have
                            the ability to change and read his own secret after publishing.</li>
                        <li><code>a=</code> Address of recipient. Encoded using Base64 URL safe encoding. Only included in invite links.</li>
                        <li><code>t=</code> Title of secret. Encoded using Base64 URL safe encoding. Only included in invite links.</li>
                        <li><code>u=</code> Public key of secret. Encoded using Base64 URL safe encoding. Only included in invite links.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2>Data blob format</h2>
                    <p>
                        The decrypted contents of the secrets data blob is simply a ZIP file. The custom document is stored as a file called ".delta" in the
                        format of <a href="https://quilljs.com/docs/delta/">Quill Delta</a>. All other files are in the ZIP file with their original file names.
