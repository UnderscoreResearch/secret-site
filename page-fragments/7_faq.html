                        Why not provide a way of resetting a lost password?
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        To be able the reset or change a password the service would inherently need to be able to know what the encryption keys are and then
                        optionally based on the password provide access to them. I do not trust (And based on past performance neither should most other
                        services) that I would be able to create service that is safe to data loss.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However, by creating the service in such a way that nothing confidential is ever retained by the service there is nothing that can
                        be accidentally disclosed by a successful intrusion by a malicious attacker.

                        What does the service know about your information?

                    <p>
                        In the case of a legally binding order to hand over all information what information does the service have to disclose?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The service has the entire submitted information encrypted using either public key encryption or symmetric encryption with a 256-bit key.
                         It does not at any point have the key required to decrypt this data.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The service has all addresses to the caretakers encrypted using a symmetric 256-bit key based encryption. It does not at any point have
                        the decryption keys required decrypt this information. The exception to this is that the addresses are submitted when a message is sent
                        if the service is used for sending those messages. However, this data is not retained in any way. The other exception to this is if you
                        have opted to have service-based notification of unlocks in which case the email address of the creator is saved unencrypted with the secret.
                        If this option is not specified, the only way the service would be able to find a specific secret is by its 16 byte long secret identifier.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The key used for decrypting the secret is never stored in the service except as the shared secrets encrypted using the individual
                        caretaker's public keys (The corresponding private keys are never known to the service).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The individual caretaker unlock keys are stored with the service encrypted using the public key of each caretaker. The corresponding
                        private key is never known to the service.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The service does know how many caretakers are available for unlocking the secret. However, it does not know how many are required to
                        completely retrieve the key. This information is encrypted as part of the keys.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        During an unlock each submitted unlock key is encrypted using the public key of the caretaker requesting the unlock. The corresponding
                        private key is never known to the service.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The service has the double SHA-256 hashes of both the secret unlock key and the double SHA-256 hashes of the keys for encrypting each
                        individual caretaker's addresses. During the sending of a message or the retrieval of the secret the single SHA-256 hash of the
                        corresponding keys is submitted to the service.
                    </p>
                    <h2>
                        How can you in good conscience provide a service whose contents you cannot access under any circumstances?
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        The way a service like this could operate comes down to two different modes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The first is that you implicitly trust the operator of the service to both keep your information safe and to diligent fight for your
                        privacy. This would require a major corporation that both has the resources required to safeguard such an obvious target and the
                        resources to fight for you with governments to safeguard your privacy. Even in those cases that trust is usually misplaced as seen
                        with the close to daily data breaches occurring all over the internet.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The other way of operating a service like this is to simply have nothing that could be misplaced. This requires you as the customer
                        not to have any trust in the creator and operator of the service. It also makes the site a non-attractive target for hackers because
                        there really is nothing here to steal. Even if the entire repository of secrets were made available publicly the only feature of this
                        site that would be compromised is the 7-day quarantine on unlocking information.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Finally, several intentional decisions were made during the design of how this site operates to make it a very bad communication
                        channel. These include the requirement to have at least 3 recipients of any message, the mandatory 7-days quarantine upon unlocking
                        the service and finally it is really expensive as a communication channel costing $1 per message. Another reason is that any key
                        generated with the service will be long and complicated enough that a user would most likely need to store it somewhere since it
                        cannot be remembered. This means that there is a way of accessing the information, it just isn't going through the service itself.

                        Are there any known vulnerabilities?
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        Yes, there are several minor vulnerabilities currently known.
                    </p>
                    <h3>
                        Man in the middle
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        There is a possible man in the middle attack possible during the invitation phase of the secret creation where if another entity
                        manages to intercept the invitation email it can be accepted by somebody else than the intended recipients. Therefore, you are
                        encouraged to contact your secret caretakers out of band (Give them a call for instance) and validate their public key fingerprint
                        to protect against this vulnerability.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you wish to be really paranoid you can print out the caretaker invitations locally and hand deliver them to your intended recipients.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Another remediation for this problem is that when using the service for sending notifications it will send them from at least three
                        different regions in the world hopefully making it harder for a single entity to intercept all the messages.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        If somebody were to get to the service and delete the files that store the information or recipients, the information would no longer
                        be retrievable. This is partially on purpose since if there were additional backups those could also be used to retrieve deleted
                        information. With the current design once information is deleted from the service it is irretrievably gone.

                        The elliptic curve encryption algorithms used for public key encryption and signing used by this service are not considered safe from
