                    <p>The current pricing is an introductory pricing that will be increased once the site has matured.</p>
                    <p>
                        Crypto currency pricing is significantly more expensive than a conventional payment because of the volatility of these currencies
                        and the need to make sure that they cover the operating cost of the service which is priced in US dollars. However, they do
                        provide improved privacy since this service has no information about who made the payment.
